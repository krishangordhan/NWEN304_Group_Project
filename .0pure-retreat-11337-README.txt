-If the folder pure-retreat-11337 is not there then make a new folder outside your group project directory then use the following:
 -heroku login
 -herou git:clone -a pure-retreat-11337
 -
 -this will make a folder for you with all the files on the heroku app
 -
 -If you need help whith updating the heroku code e.g adding new REST commads.
 -
 --First check to see of the heroku repository is added to the pure retreat folder
 -	type: git remote -v
 -	into a console opened inside of the pure-retreat-11337 folder
 -
 --You should see the following lines included in the list:
 -	heroku  https://git.heroku.com/pure-retreat-11337.git (fetch)
 -	heroku  https://git.heroku.com/pure-retreat-11337.git (push)
 -
 --If you dont use this command:
 -	heroku git:remote -a pure-retreat-11337
 -	you should only have to do this once
 -
 --Now if you make some changes you want to push to heroku:
 -	first type: 	git status
 -	this should list what changes you made
 -	next type:	git add filename
 -	for each file you want to update
 -	now type git commit -m "some message here"
 -	ALWAYS PUT A MESSAGE EVEN IF YOU DONT WANT TO TYPE SOMETHING. that gave me a lot of trouble so at least put something there
 -	Next type: git push heroku master
 -	And that will update the heroku repository
